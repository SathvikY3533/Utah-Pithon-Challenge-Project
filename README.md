# Utah-Pithon-Challenge-Project
This is my 2nd place entry for the Utah Pithon Challenge: Air and Water Quality monitoring and logging system
From December 2021 to May 2022
-----

The necessary libraries needed for this code to work are not in this repository as most of them are only found in files hidden deep inside my raspberry pi :( . So here is a list of the libraries I imported in order for the lcd diplays, the photoresistor, and the air quaility sensor to work.

Libraries Used:
1. CSV
2. ADC0834
3. Adafruit_IO
4. Adafruit_GPIO.SPI
5. Adafruit_SSD1306
6. PIL
